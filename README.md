# Magento1_Delete_from_Order_Grid
Remove columns from order grid programmatically

Another smallll extension for Magento 1, to keep it clean we don't have a gui, config is done in the file itself.
Sorry in this initial release the columns to remove from the sales grid are mentioned in the observer file, but cleaner
and faster than his I can not make it.

If you find it useful, please like :-)

Thanks!

La revedere,

Paul
